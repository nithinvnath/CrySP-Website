# CrySP-Website
Website for the CrySP Lab

Notes
------
* The website is written as a single html page.
* Clicking on each item in the nav-bar simply hides/unhides the section [Not very elegant, but it works]
* For the hiding/unhiding to work, the divId should be the corresponding id in Navbar + "Div"
* The email ids can be encrypted using http://www.rot13.com/ Hopefully, this will offer some protection against spam email crawlers
* To change the footer height, in the css file change both the margin-bottom of the body style and the height in the .footer style
* Try to keep the image file size as low as possible since all the images are loaded irrespective of the "page" displayed, the page load time will take a hit otherwise.
* The photos in the people page work best if cropped to a square shape. Ideally 640x640 or something close to that.
